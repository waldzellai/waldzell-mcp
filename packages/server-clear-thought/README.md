```

## Usage

### Mental Models
```typescript
const response = await mcp.callTool("mentalmodel", {
  modelName: "first_principles",
  problem: "How to implement a new feature?",
  steps: [
    "Break down the problem",
    "Analyze components",
    "Build solution"
  ]
});
```

  ]
});
```

```typescript
// Using log analysis approach
const response = await mcp.callTool("debuggingapproach", {
  approachName: "log_analysis",
  issue: "System fails intermittently with no obvious error messages",
  steps: [
    "Collect all system logs",
    "Sort by timestamp", 
    "Identify anomaly patterns around failure points",
    "Analyze service interactions"
  ],
  findings: "Database connection timeout warnings detected before system failures",
  resolution: "Increase database connection timeout values and implement retry mechanism"
});
```

### Sequential Thinking
