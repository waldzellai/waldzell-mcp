# TODOs: forge-cli
- Wire commands to real implementations: spec (SpecWizard), propose (proposer), eval (evalRunner), redteam, select, reproduce, ui.
- Add config loading/validation with defaults surfaced; friendly errors and exit codes.
- Implement structured logging with --verbose; path overrides for outputs.
- Support progress streaming and candidate ID returns for propose/eval/select.
- Add smoke run for demo dataset; tests for CLI error handling.
