# TODOs: forge-ui
- Implement data adapters to read artifacts (archives/manifests/metrics) or API.
- Build views: runs list, candidate compare (manifests/metrics/novelty), trace viewer, redteam report view.
- Add filters/search, winner selection indicators, and reproduce triggers.
- Show model pins, sandbox/egress policy, and config per candidate.
- Add lightweight charts; error toasts; handle missing data gracefully.
- Ensure Vite build passes.
