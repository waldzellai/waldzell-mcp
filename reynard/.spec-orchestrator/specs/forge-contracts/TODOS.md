# TODOs: forge-contracts
- Discover contracts/ or annotated tests in candidate archives via config.
- Run property/fuzz tests; capture pass/fail, logs, and flaky detection via multiple runs.
- Enforce semver gates based on contract compatibility; suggest version bump.
- Return structured results with failures, coverage, fuzz seeds.
- Handle missing contracts with warning, not crash.
